Plugin Hacking Guide          20001124PZ
----------------------------------------

Step One:
Have a look at ./statistik/vorlage.C,
and copy it into the best matching subdir, one of

background  filter1d  filter2d  misc  statistik  transform

using a new plugin name. (here: "myplugin.C")
The file "myplugin.C" includes a quick GxsmPlugin Guide, please follow...

Change into the subdir!

Step Two:
Adding your myplugin.C to the Makefile.am, located in the same directory:

1.) The Makefile.am has a list of all libs to build, add "libmyplugin.la":

lib_LTLIBRARIES = \
	libhistogram.la \
	libhistoHOP.la \
	libspasim.la \          <=== the line before should end with "\" !!
	libmyplugin.la          <=== add "myplugin" as here

2.) add the compiler instructions like:

libmyplugin_la_SOURCES = myplugin.C [mypluginhelp.C, ...]  <=== here you cann add more .C sources !!
libmyplugin_la_LDFLAGS = -export-dynamic -avoid-version

That's all to do for Makefile.am.


Step Three:
Build:

make
make install

Test:
Start gxsm   or call   Gxsm->Tools->Reload Plugins
Check Plugins Description, [About, Configure] using the "Gxsm->Tools->Plugin Details" Viewer
Test Plugins action


Step Four:
please publish!

If you are a SF-Gxsm project member:
sfcvs update
sfcvs add myplugin.C ...
sfcvf commit

or send Plugin-Srcs to zahl@users.sourceforge.net
