% -- subdir math/filter2d --

The \emph{math/filter2d} plugins are all type of math doing something
in 2D with the data, e.g. a 2D powerspectrum or all types of 2D
FFT-filters. But special 2D statistical analysis or geometric
transformation filters are going into a separate sections
\emph{math/statistics, transformations}.

\subsubsection{Gxsm core 2D convolution filter support}

The Gxsm core provides support for a generalized convolution, just
providing the convolution kernel function itself.  The minimal kernel
size is $2R+1$, it is automatically increased until non zero matrix
elements are appearing.

A convolution kernel is provided by a kernel function like this
Gaus-Kernel:
\[ K_{ij} = 4*e^{-\frac{i^2+j^2}{r^2}} \]

The convolution itself is defined as:
\[ Z'(n,m) = \sum_{-R \le i \le R}  \sum_{-R \le j \le R} Z(n+i,m+j) \cdot K_{i j} \]

For all PlugIns using the convolution method, just the kernel will be
documented in the following descriptions.
