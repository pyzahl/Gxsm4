** install the TI "cgtools-c5500" in /opt/TI/cgtools-c55 -- tested with:
TMS320C55x Code Generation Tools Release Version 2.56 

** to build the DSP binary for the MK2-A810 (strongly recommended for all SPM
application with feedback loop) type:

make clean
make

** to build a DSP binary for the MK2-Analog16 (AIC24) you can build a
binary as well, this is less tested and not main stream:

make clean
make -f Makefile-A16


** take the generated COFF file FB_spmcontrol.out (or ..-A16.out) to a
MS Win based system and use the by SoftdB provided minidebugger to
load (reflash) the DSP code. Depending on the previous FPGA
configuration, you may need to have the correspondinf FPGA (.rbt) file
as well. 

SR2_Analog_810_V200.rbt

or 

SR2_Analog_16.rbt

** power cycle the DSP and plug into your Linux system.

** make sure the kernel module is in place and device permissions are
configured via udev or manually via chmod for every one to read/write.

** use "dmesg" command to check module messages/status
