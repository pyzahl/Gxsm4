\label{sec:HwI-PlugIns}
Here are the GXSM-2 \emph{hard}, i.e. Hardware Interface (HwI), type
plugins. These are a special subset of GXSM plugins and only one or
none is selected on GXSM startup. HwI plugins are very similar to
standart GXSM plugins from design point of view, except of a special
and independent load strategy. A HwI plugin provides a
\GxsmSymbol{category} (same as used in standart type plugins for
automatic plugin selection), this is used here to match the
\GxsmPref{Hardware}{Card}.

The hardware interface itself is created by providing one (or more)
specialized derivation(s) of the GXSM core base class
\GxsmSymbol{XSM\_Hardware}, which defines a default set of (virtual)
generalized SPM-control functions to be overloaded later.  A pointer
to one instance of this new class has to be returned by the HwI
plugins \GxsmSymbol{get\_gxsm\_hwi\_hardware\_class(void *data)}
function which is resolved by the GXSM core HwI plugin handler. And
called to register the hardware for later use.

The current GXSM main stream and best supported hardware is the
SignalRanger DSP board, see \ref{pi:srangerhwi}.
