Notes on patching recereat file if plain form vivado

1) remove all sections in tcl file requireing any .dcp files -- no need.
2) remove potentially removed/old project file (/rtl/axi4_stream_fifo.v may be present) fro mdependency list of file, not needed:
 "[file normalize "$origin_dir/rtl/axi4_stream_fifo.v"]"\   <-- delete line


3) adjust project name.
   find set origin_proj_dir and _xil_proj_name, match up to a name of your choice:

set orig_proj_dir "[file normalize "$origin_dir/project_RP-SPMC-PACPLL-Gxsm4"]"

set _xil_proj_name_ "project_RP-SPMC-PACPLL-Gxsm4"
