## Goal

Our goal is to provide a space where it is safe for everyone to contribute to,
and get support for, open-source software in a respectful and cooperative manner.

We value all contributions and want to make this project and its surrounding community a place for everyone.

As members, contributors, and everyone else who may participate in the
development, we strive to keep the entire experience civil.


## Standards

Our science and SPM community standards exist in order to make sure everyone feels comfortable
contributing to the project(s) together and make it better.

Some of our standards are:
 - Do not harass, attack, or in any other way discriminate against anyone. Including, but not limited to, sex, religion, race,
appearance, gender, identity, nationality, sexuality, etc.
 - Do not go off-topic, do not post spam.
 - Treat everyone with respect.

Examples of breaking each rule respectively include:
 - Harassment, bullying or inappropriate jokes about another person.
 - Posting distasteful imagery, trolling, or posting things unrelated to the topic at hand.
 - Treating someone as worse because of their lack of understanding of an issue.





## Part of the GNU General Public License (GPL)

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a software license, not a code of conduct for personal or ethical behavior.
The term "code of conduct" in the context of the GPL refers to the license's strict rules for distributing and modifying software that uses it, which are legally binding. 
The GPL's primary function is to enforce "copyleft," a legal mechanism that ensures software freedom. It is "viral" in that any work derived from GPL-licensed software must also be released under the GPL. 

### Core principles (The four freedoms)

The Free Software Foundation, which created the GPL, bases the license on four fundamental user freedoms: 

   - Freedom to run: Users can run the program for any purpose.
   - Freedom to study and modify: Users can study how the program works and adapt it to their needs. This requires providing access to the source code.
   - Freedom to redistribute: Users can redistribute copies of the original program.
   - Freedom to distribute modified versions: Users can distribute copies of their modified versions to others. 

### Key requirements and constraints

Any use or redistribution of GPL-licensed software is subject to the following rules:

  - Source code distribution: If you distribute a program based on GPL-licensed code, you must also provide the complete corresponding source code to the recipients.
  - Maintain the license: All modified or derivative works must be licensed under the GPL. You cannot add additional restrictions that would limit the freedoms granted by the original license.
  - Attribution and notice: The software must carry conspicuous notices indicating that it is covered by the GPL and must include a copy of the license itself.
  - No warranty: The GPL explicitly states that the software comes with absolutely no warranty. Users assume all risk associated with using the program.
